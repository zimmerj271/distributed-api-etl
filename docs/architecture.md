# Architecture
This document describes the high-level architecture of the Spark API-Driven ETL Framework. 

## Overview
Performing parallel and concurrent HTTP requests to RESTful API endpoints in Spark is not trivial due to challenges around managing distributed compute architecture. Most implementations use suboptimal approaches:

* **Driver-only requests** — defeats Spark's parallelism and does not scale for large datasets
* **Multithreading with `requests` library** — achieves concurrency but uses blocking I/O, substantially increasing time between requests

This design maximizes API request throughput by layering concurrency at multiple levels:

1) **Cluster-level parallelism**: Spark distributes partitions across worker nodes
2) **Partition-level concurrency**: asyncio.Queue enables concurrent processing of multiple rows within each partition with backpressure control
3) **Request-level concurrency**: aiohttp's non-blocking I/O allows the event loop to handle multiple in-flight HTTP requests simultaneously on each worker

The framework supports common HTTP authentication mechanisms, including OAuth2.0 and mTLS. Request/response processing is handled through a **middleware layer** for payload transformation and a **transport layer** for HTTP execution.

The framework is organized into three architectural layers:

| Layer            | Responsibility                                                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Pipeline Config  | Declarative pipeline definition via YAML/JSON with Pydantic validation         |
| Driver-side      | Orchestration, batching, driver-side authentication, and resource distribution |
| Executor-side    | Concurrent request execution, middleware processing, worker-side authentication|

### Batch Processing and Idempotency

All pipelines process data in configurable batches (default: 10000 rows). This design choice enforces idempotency:

- **Checkpoint tracking**: Each batch completion is recorded, enabling safe pipeline restarts
- **Partial failure recovery**: Failed batches can be retried without reprocessing successful ones
- **Memory management**: Bounded batch sizes prevent executor memory exhaustion
- **Progress visibility**: Batch-level metrics provide granular execution monitoring

Larger batches reduce overhead but increase memory usage and retry cost. Smaller batches provide finer-grained checkpointing at the cost of more Spark actions.

### Key Design Principles

- **Factory-based composition**: All components (transport, auth, middleware) are instantiated via serializable factories, ensuring they work across Spark's distributed boundaries
- **Extensible design**: Abstract interfaces and dependency injection enable custom authentication, middleware, and transport implementations without modifying framework code
- **Process-scoped resources**: HTTP sessions and connections are reused across partition executions on the same worker for efficiency
- **Separation of concerns**: Authentication, retry logic, logging, and transport are decoupled through middleware layers
- **Idempotency**: Required batch processing with checkpointing ensures pipeline resilience and safe re-execution after failures

### Architecture Diagrams

The following sections provide visual representations of the framework:
- **[Driver-Side Execution](#driver-side-exectuion)** - Driver → Workers → Response collection
- **[Worker-Side Exectuion](#worker-side-execution)** - Row processing, middleware, and transport
- **[Concurrent Request Processing](#concurrent-request-processing)** - Producer/consumer pattern with `asyncio.Queue`
- **[Middleware Pipeline](#middleware-pipeline)** - Injector pattern middleware pipeline

### When to Use This Framework

This framework is ideal for:
- **High-volume API ingestion**: Processing millions of records requiring individual API calls
- **Rate-limited APIs**: Backpressure control prevents overwhelming API endpoints
- **Long-running pipelines**: OAuth2 token refresh and session management for jobs exceeding token lifetimes
- **Complex authentication**: Built-in support for OAuth2, mTLS, and custom auth patterns

**Not recommended for:**
- Systems with native Spark connectors (BigQuery, Snowflake, Kafka) - use the connector instead
- APIs offering bulk export files (CSV/Parquet downloads) - download directly
- Single-request extractions - Python `requests` library is simpler
- APIs with per-second rate limits incompatible with any concurrency

## Concurrent Request Processing

The `ApiPartitionExecutor` uses an **asyncio producer-consumer pattern** with bounded concurrency to process partition rows in parallel, rather than sequentially.

### Row-level concurrency

```
**Key Components:**

- **Producer**: Feeds rows from the partition iterator into the queue, then sends sentinel values (`None`) to signal completion
- **Queue**: Provides backpressure and ensures thread-safe communication between producer and consumers
- **Consumer Pool**: `concurrency_limit` (default 20) concurrent workers that pull rows, execute requests, and collect responses
- **Gather**: Waits for all consumers to complete and combines their results

### Row Processing Execution Timeline

        end
        loop Send sentinels
            Prod->>Q: put(None) × N
        end
    and Consumer 1 processes
        loop Until sentinel
            C1->>Q: get()
            Q-->>C1: row
            C1->>API: HTTP request
            API-->>C1: response
            C1->>C1: collect result
        end
    and Consumer 2 processes
        loop Until sentinel
            C2->>Q: get()
            Q-->>C2: row
            C2->>API: HTTP request
            API-->>C2: response
            C2->>C2: collect result
        end
    and Consumer N processes
        loop Until sentinel
            CN->>Q: get()
            Q-->>CN: row
            CN->>API: HTTP request
            API-->>CN: response
            CN->>CN: collect result
        end
    end
    
    Async->>Async: gather(all results)
    Async->>Async: flatten & build rows
    Async-->>Sync: list[Row]
    Sync-->>Spark: return results
```

**Execution Flow:**

1. **Initialization**: Spark calls the synchronous wrapper which starts the async event loop
2. **Task Creation**: Producer and N consumer tasks are created and scheduled concurrently
3. **Parallel Execution**: 
   - Producer feeds rows into the queue as fast as consumers can process
   - Consumers pull rows, make HTTP requests, and collect responses independently
   - The queue provides natural backpressure when consumers are slower than the producer
4. **Completion**: Producer sends sentinel values; consumers exit when they receive sentinels
5. **Collection**: All consumer results are gathered, flattened, and returned to Spark

### Performance Benefits

With `concurrency_limit=20`, a partition of 1000 rows can process up to 20 HTTP requests simultaneously rather than sequentially. This can result in **10-20x throughput improvement** for I/O-bound API calls, with the actual speedup depending on:

- API response times
- Network latency
- Rate limits on the target API
- Available system resources

The concurrency limit prevents overwhelming the target API while maximizing throughput within safe bounds.


### Async `aiohttp` vs Multithreaded `request`
In many distributed HTTP request Spark applications, concurrency is achieved on the Spark worker by pairing multithreading with the `requests` library. However, because the `request` library is synchronous, it creates an I/O blocking condition during each request in which subsequent requests are required to wait until the current process has been completed. I/O blocking causes two unintended problems with this implementation: 
1) creates iterative processing when concurrent processing is intended
2) adds overhead by the OS due to context switching between threads.


## Middleware Pipeline

Middleware is executed in the order it is configured, wrapping each subsequent middleware:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    request["Request"]
    
    subgraph mw_a["Middleware A"]
        direction TB
        subgraph mw_b["Middleware B"]
            direction TB
            subgraph mw_c["Middleware C"]
                direction TB
                http_req["HTTP Request"]
                http_resp["HTTP Response"]
                
                http_req --> http_resp
            end
        end
    end
    
    response["Response"]
    
    request --> mw_a
    mw_a --> response
    
    style mw_a fill:#28a745,stroke:#1e7e34,color:#fff
    style mw_b fill:#20c997,stroke:#17a673,color:#fff
    style mw_c fill:#17a2b8,stroke:#117a8b,color:#fff
    style http_req fill:#1168bd,stroke:#0d4884,color:#fff
    style http_resp fill:#dc3545,stroke:#bd2130,color:#fff
    style request fill:#6c757d,stroke:#495057,color:#fff
    style response fill:#6c757d,stroke:#495057,color:#fff
```

This allows middleware to run logic **before and/or after** the HTTP request.
